\title{\pkg{music}: Learn and use music theory}
\description{
The music package allows you to build, play, and visualize scales, chords, and chord progression.
For playback, \pkg{music} builds waveforms as matrices and passes them to the \pkg{audio} package which
interfaces with the system's audio driver.
The default notation and frequencies used throughout the package are based on twelve-tone equal temperament tuning
(12ET). Custom tuning can be defined by specifying frequency ratios and a root  note. See \link{note2freq}.
A4 defaults to 440Hz, and can be changed with the 'A4' argument.
