Description: An aid for learning and using music theory. You can build chords, scales, and chord progressions using 12-note equal temperament tuning (12-ET) or user-defined custom intonations. Includes functions to visualize notes on a piano using ASCII plots in the console and to plot waveforms using base graphics. It allows simple playback of notes and chords using the 'audio' package.
